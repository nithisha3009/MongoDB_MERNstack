# Book a Doctor - MERN Stack Application

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application for booking doctor appointments. It provides a user-friendly interface for users, especially elderly individuals, to schedule medical appointments easily.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for patients and doctors.
- **Doctor Profiles**: View available doctors, their specialties, and working hours.
- **Appointment Booking**: Schedule appointments based on availability.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users, doctors, and appointments.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14+)
- **MongoDB** (local instance or MongoDB Atlas)
- **NPM** or **Yarn**
- **Git**

---

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nithisha3009/MongoDB_MERNstack.git
cd MongoDB_MERNstack
```
#### MongoDB URI Instructions:

Hereâ€™s a quick guide on how to get the MongoDB URI from MongoDB Atlas and use it in your project.

### Steps to Get MongoDB Atlas URI

1. **Sign in to MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign in with your account.
   - If you don't have an account, you will need to create one and set up a free cluster.

2. **Create a Cluster** (if not already created):
   - After signing in, click **Create a Cluster** and follow the instructions.
   - Choose a free tier cluster for development purposes.

3. **Create a Database User**:
   - Once your cluster is ready, go to the **Database Access** tab.
   - Click **Add New Database User**.
   - Set up a username and password (remember these, as you'll need them in the URI).

4. **Whitelist Your IP Address**:
   - In the **Network Access** tab, click **Add IP Address**.
   - Add your current IP address or allow access from anywhere by adding `0.0.0.0/0` (not recommended for production).

5. **Get the MongoDB URI**:
   - Go to the **Clusters** section, click **Connect** on your cluster.
   - In the connection dialog, select **Connect your application**.
   - You'll see a connection string that looks something like this:

   ```
   mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

6. **Modify the URI**:
   - Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<dbname>` with your actual database username, password, and database name.

   Example:

   ```bash
   mongodb+srv://yourUserName:yourPassword@cluster0.mongodb.net/yourDBName?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

### Update `.env` File

Once you have the MongoDB URI, update your `.env` file in the `admin` folder as follows:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://yourUserName:yourPassword@cluster0.mongodb.net/yourDBName?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Make sure:

- You keep your `.env` file secure and **do not** commit it to version control (GitHub, etc.).
- The `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<dbname>` are correctly set with your MongoDB Atlas credentials.

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend (Admin Module)

Navigate to the `admin` folder and use the following command to start the backend server:

```bash
cd.. /backend
npm install
```
```bash
npm run server
```
This will start the backend server on `http://localhost:5000` by default (or any port specified in the `.env` file).


### 2. Admin (Backend)
shift the dirsctory to admin in terminal

- **Development Mode**: Use `npm run dev` to start the server with automatic restarts when changes are made.

```bash
cd.. /admin
npm install
```

## 3. Start the Frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and start the React development server:

```bash
cd.. /frontend
npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend server on `http://localhost:3000`.
This will create a production build of the frontend in the `build/` folder.


This updated `README.md` reflects the modular structure of your project with **admin** and **frontend** components, along with updated instructions for installing dependencies and running both parts of the application. Adjust the content as needed for your project specifics!
