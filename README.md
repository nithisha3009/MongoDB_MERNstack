# Book a Doctor - MERN Stack Application

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application for booking doctor appointments. It provides a user-friendly interface for users, especially elderly individuals, to schedule medical appointments easily.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for patients and doctors.
- **Doctor Profiles**: View available doctors, their specialties, and working hours.
- **Appointment Booking**: Schedule appointments based on availability.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users, doctors, and appointments.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14+)
- **MongoDB** (local instance or MongoDB Atlas)
- **NPM** or **Yarn**
- **Git**

---

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-a-doctor.git
cd book-a-doctor
```

### 2. Install dependencies

#### Backend (Node.js + Express.js)
Navigate to the backend folder and install the required packages.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Frontend (React.js)
Navigate to the frontend folder and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder to set up the following environment variables:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

If you're using third-party services for email notifications or file storage (optional), you might need these:

```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=your_email_service
EMAIL_USER=your_email_address
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
```

---

## Running the Application

### 1. Run the Backend

In the `backend` folder, run the following command to start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

### 2. Run the Frontend

In the `frontend` folder, run the following command to start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Access the Application

Open your browser and go to:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Additional Commands

### Backend

- **Development Mode**: Use `nodemon` for automatic server restart when code changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- **Run Tests**: (if you have tests set up):

```bash
npm test
```

### Frontend

- **Build for Production**:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production build in the `build/` folder.


This `README.md` provides all the necessary steps to get your project running, from cloning the repository to setting up environment variables and running the frontend and backend services. Adjust the content as per your project's specific details!
